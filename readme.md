## Description
This challenge involves 4 developers collaborating to create a game, but with a unique twist - there will be no communication allowed between the contributors throughout the development process. Each developer will work on a specific part of the game and pass it on to the next person, without any discussion or coordination.

The goal is to create an engaging and coherent game experience, despite the lack of direct collaboration. The final product will be a testament to the developers' individual skills and their ability to build upon each other's work seamlessly.
## Challenge Goal
The primary goal of this challenge is to foster skill development in Unity game engine and various aspects of game development. By working individually on different components of the game without direct collaboration, each developer will have the opportunity to strengthen their existing skills and acquire new ones.

Throughout the challenge, developers will be tasked with implementing various game mechanics, level designs, user interfaces, and other elements that will require them to explore and utilize various features and tools within Unity. This hands-on experience will allow them to deepen their understanding of game development concepts and best practices.

Additionally, the challenge will encourage developers to showcase their creativity, problem-solving abilities, and adaptability as they work to integrate their contributions seamlessly into the overall game experience.
